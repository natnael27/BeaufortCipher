# BEAUFORT CIPHER
The Beaufort cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that was invented by Sir Francis Beaufort in the early 19th century. 
It is similar to the Vigen√®re cipher in that it uses a keyword to encrypt the plaintext, but instead of adding the keyword to the plaintext, it subtracts it from the ciphertext.

To encrypt a message using the Beaufort cipher, the sender first chooses a keyword and repeats it until it is the same length as the plaintext. 
Then, for each letter in the plaintext, the corresponding letter from the keyword is found and subtracted from the plaintext letter (mod 26) to produce the ciphertext letter. 
To decrypt the message, the recipient repeats the process with the same keyword, but instead of subtracting the keyword from the ciphertext, they add it to produce the original plaintext.
